# Graphit Knowledge

`project_dir` is a runtime MCP argument, not persisted project identity. In docs, Task, Memory and handoffs save project identity plus repository-relative paths; never copy a machine-specific checkout root. Resolve the local root again on each host.

Knowledge maintains user/technical documentation by business domain and reader goal. Make it usable by someone or another project without this conversation. Task owns executable specifications/plans/results; AST proves code behavior; Memory holds durable constraints.

## Load detail at the decision boundary

Retrieval alone needs no reference. Before planning/reorganizing docs or reviewing domain coverage, read [documentation design](references/documentation-design.md). Before first substantive domain authoring, read [worked domain](references/worked-domain.md); adapt depth, not its stack/rules/file count. Narrow maintenance needs only the design reference's per-unit consistency section when guidance is missing. Reuse retained references. `DOCS_ROOT` means this project's `docs/` or its existing authoritative location.
If local reference files are unavailable, use `graphit_module_skill` with `module: knowledge`, `reference: references/documentation-design.md` or `references/worked-domain.md`, and the known `project_dir` when available; request only the needed reference.

## Retrieve enough evidence

1. Reuse a known slug with `graphit_wiki_source`; otherwise `graphit_knowledge_search` for the project/installed `context`, or `graphit_wiki_search` across selected `wikis`/`hub_refs`. Reuse known absolute `project_dir`; for unresolved ecosystem projects, read the Hub skill and use `graphit_cluster_projects` before the Hub catalog. Hub-only: announce/install needed Knowledge and query it; the question authorizes preparation. Only without a local checkout, omit `project_dir` and use resolved installed qualified `id@version`. Public technology (e.g. React) needs no Hub lookup; use known knowledge/official docs and verify current details.
2. Use focused terms, `top_k: 5`, `ai_optimized: true`; `preview: true` only to disambiguate titles. Titles are not evidence. Read selected `graphit_wiki_source` pages with returned slug as `path`, preserving project/context. Slice long pages; expand for relevant surrounding rules.
3. Reuse results; stop once sources answer the question. Follow `next_cursor` for unresolved coverage/exhaustive inventory only. A miss is not absence: refine once or use `graphit_wiki_browse` with relevant `doc_type`; `graphit_knowledge_list` is for an intended catalogue.
4. Use `graphit_wiki_xrefs` with a shallow depth for unresolved provenance/relationships, or `graphit_wiki_log` for change history. Do not load either for every page.

Reuse known Task context. For a missing prior-work decision/plan, read the Task skill, use one focused `graphit_task_search` and selected `graphit_task_get`; do not pair every lookup with history. If Task is unavailable, continue and state the resulting uncertainty.

## Design and write maintained documentation

Map domains, actors/journeys, rules/contracts, implementation evidence and page targets in Task before writing. Extend existing navigation: root → domain → user/technical/operation pages as needed. File count/headings do not prove coverage; no empty skeletons or generic overview replacing unrelated domains.
Write in `docs/` or the authoritative source, never the generated wiki/store. Users need prerequisites, steps, outcomes and errors/recovery; consumers need contracts, boundaries, data/state, source/version, operations and provenance. Link shared facts; keep examples consistent. Label proposed behavior, assumptions and unverified findings. Resolve scope in Task without inventing rules. Authorized docs maintenance needs no extra approval.

## Verify both directions for every work unit

For EVERY code work unit, inspect/update affected user/technical docs, examples and navigation in that unit. For EVERY doc work unit, inspect corresponding implementation with AST and validate its claims. Check rule → source/test → page and changed page → implementation/consumers; inspect affected references for contradictions. No-impact conclusions name inspected targets and rationale.
Resolve drift: correct stale docs, fix authorized defects, or label future intent/current limitations and preserve unresolved work in Task. Never weaken a requirement to bless a bug or expand code scope to match a draft. Verify relevant commands/examples, links and outcomes. Distinguish documentation quality from implementation agreement, executed tests from inspection. Before unit completion record targets, version/scope, actual evidence, findings and next action in Task progress/checks. The references show review criteria and both drift directions.

Other-project documentation is read only through its resolved wiki tools. If required MCP tools are unavailable or current-project text is unindexed, use focused native reads of current-project authoritative documents, state the fallback once and do not substitute the Graphit CLI.

## Freshness and maintenance

The daemon indexes `docs/` after writes. Use `graphit_knowledge_index` for missing coverage or a specific directory; `graphit_knowledge_sync` only when knowledge freshness is needed for a decision, or `graphit_sync` when multiple indexes must align. Do not duplicate the asynchronous completion hook. On stale/locked reads, check `graphit_daemon_status`; retry a transient failure once before reporting it.

Use `graphit_knowledge_lint`/`graphit_knowledge_schema` for diagnostics, `graphit_wiki_embed` for missing semantic coverage, and `graphit_knowledge_export` for requested exports. `graphit_knowledge_remove` without `context` clears the project wiki; never reset to repair search. For reuse through Hub, make scope/version, prerequisites, supported contracts, navigation and provenance self-contained; use the Hub skill at publication/consumption boundaries. Documentation maintenance alone does not publish an artifact.
